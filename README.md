# splashplayer_subtitlef_ixer
Fixes the Subtitles in Splash Player

This Plugin fixes the broken subtitle parsing that is still present in Mirillis
Splash Player after 3 years of the issue having first been reported.

The attached images will explain the effect of this tool much better than I could.

Enjoy.
